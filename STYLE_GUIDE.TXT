Introduction
------------
This document is draft status.  Mostly just to remind myself to 
use a consistent style as anything else.

Unified coding style is important because it eases software review 
and maintenance.  This file specifies guidelines which can be broken 
for specific cases, but should be adhered to as closely as possible.

/* Below is for apache.  Try to do similar? */
This style can be generated with the following arguments to GNU indent:

      -i4 -npsl -di0 -br -nce -d0 -cli0 -npcs -nfc1 -nut

Files
-----
Third-party code should be placed in separate files, and should be 
clearly identified, so that no mistake in licensing occurs.

Indentation
-----------
Indentation should be 4 spaces.  Tabs are allowed, but you must set 
your tab stop to 8 spaces.  Note that this is not the default 
for Microsoft Visual Studio compilers, so you should adjust your setting.

Line breaking
-------------
Code should be limited to 80 columns when possible.  Use typedefs to 
assist in this process.

Curly braces
------------
Use GNU curly brace style (curly on its own line) for function 
definitions, and K&R curly brace style (curly on same line as conditional)
everywhere else.

Always use curly braces for if/do/while/for statements, even if there 
is only one statement in the block.

For a simple else clause, cozy it up with the previous right curly.  
For testing multiple cases, move the else keyword to a new line.

Examples:

    int
    foo (int bar)
    {
        if (bar == 3) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    int
    foo (int bar)
    {
        if (bar == 3) {
            return 1;
        }
        else if (bar == 5) {
            return 2;
        }
	else {
            return 0;
	}
    }

Switch statement
----------------
Case labels are not indented in the switch statement.  A default label 
is required (even if there is no code).

    switch (x) {
    case a:
        code;
    case b:
        code;
    case c:
    default:
        code;
    }

Function definitions
--------------------
Declaritors and return values go on a separate line (GNU style):

    static int
    foo (int bar)
    {

Use explicit "void" in the argument list if there are no arguments:

    void
    foo (void)
    {

Horizontal whitespace
---------------------
Conditionals should be laid out like this:

    if (bar == 3 && baz > 4) {

Function calls like this:

    foo (a, b);

When there are no arguments, you may omit the space:

    foo();

Pointers and references
-----------------------
As per linux kernel style, put the '*' adjacent to the data name or 
function name and not adjacent to the type name.

    char *foo;
    char *bar (char *baz, char **boo);

The reason for this rule is it allows the declaration of multiple 
variables of the same type in a single statement.

    char *p, *q, *pv, *pq;

References should not be used, except as required to interface with 
third party libraries.  When required, they go together with the type 
rather than the name.

    char& linux_banner = s1;
    char& bar (char& baz, char*& boo);

Vertical whitespace
-------------------
Only a single blank space is required between functions or between 
two groups of code.

Identifier naming
-----------------
Prefer English names, with words separated by underscores.  Use lowercase 
for function names, variable names, and structure names.  Use all upper 
case for constants.

    struct long_list {
        int list_length;
        void *list_items;
    }

    int
    my_function (struct long_list employee_list)
    {
        const int DESIRED_LENGTH = 3;
        employee_list->list_length = DESIRED_LENGTH;
    }

Names for typedefs and C++ classes should capitalize only the first letter.
Member names are lower case.

    class Volume_resizer {
    public:
        int foo;
	void bar (void);
    }

    void
    Volume_resizer::bar (void)
    {
        code;
    }
