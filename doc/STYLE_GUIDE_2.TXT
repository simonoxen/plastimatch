Introduction
------------
This is part 2 of the style guide.  It concerns how variables 
and functions should be named to maintain a uniform look and feel.

Include files
-------------
Include files should be in the following order:

 1) plm_config.h
 2) Standard C++ include files (sorted alphabetically)
 3) Standard C include files (sorted alphabetically)
 4) Third party library include files (grouped, sorted alphabetically 
    within each group if possible)
 5) Plastimatch include files (sorted alphabetically)

File names and function names
-----------------------------
Generally, files will come in pairs, one h file and one cxx file.  
These pair of files will normally define a single public
C++ class, and optionally will define a second private C++ class.

The public class name will have the same name as the h and cxx file. 
For example, the class Plm_image is defined in plm_image.h.

The private class will include the suffix "_private", and is defined 
in the cxx file.  For example, class Plm_image_private is defined in 
plm_image.cxx.

Layout of a public class definition
-----------------------------------
The first entries of the class definition specify the API 
linkage, smart pointer support, and private class data.
Next are the constructors and destructors.  For example:

class PLMBASE_API Plm_image {
public:
    SMART_POINTER_SUPPORT (Plm_image);
    Plm_image_private *d_ptr;
public:
    Plm_image ();

The token PLMBASE_API is defined in plmbase_config.h, and is 
reqired for linking with the library on windows.  The macro 
SMART_POINTER_SUPPORT specifies that this class allows the use 
of smart pointers, and is defined in smart_pointer.h.

Native layer, itk layer, wrapper layer [Proposed, not implemented]
------------------------------------------------------------------
The following prefixes should be used for these three layers:

  itk_xxxx            ## ITK layer, makes itk function calls.
  xxxx                ## Native layer
  plm_xxxx            ## Wrapper layer

Alternatives:

  plc_xxx             ## Native layer
  plm_core_xxx        ## Native layer
  plw_xxx             ## Wrapper layer

For images, we currently use this following:

  itk_image, itk      ## ITK layer
  volume              ## Native layer
  plm_image, pli      ## Wrapper layer

For complex images (multiple irregular spacings), consider the following:

  itk_volume, itk      ## ITK layer
  volume               ## Native layer
  plm_volume, plv      ## Wrapper layer

  plm_volset, plv      ## Wrapper layer (wrapper layer sufficient?)

The image header would become:

  itk_volume_header    ## ITK layer
  volume_header        ## Native layer
  plm_volume_header    ## Wrapper layer

  plm_volset_header    ## Wrapper layer (wrapper layer sufficient?)

Command line args, Function options [Proposed, not implemented]
---------------------------------------------------------------
Command line arguments are digested, and then placed in a structure 
called Xxx_args.  Example:

class Warp_args {
    ...
};

Complicated functions which are controlled by a structure full of 
options will use a structure called Xxx_opts.  Example:

typedef struct bspline_opts Bspline_opts;
struct bspline_opts {
    ...
};

N.b. The old way is to use the term "parms" for both types of structures.  

N.b. Does this even make sense?  Cxt_to_mha can use the same structure 
for both uses.

Dim, dims, offset, origin, spacing
----------------------------------
To describe the position of an image in mm, use origin, not offset.  
The term offset is used to describe an ROI in voxels.

To describe the resolution of an image in voxels, use dim, not dims.

The order of parameters should be alphabetic:

  calling_a_function (dim, origin, spacing);

Except that direction_cosines is last:

  calling_a_function (dim, origin, spacing, direction_cosines);

For itk routines, it should follow the same semantic order, 
but it becomes non-alphabetic:

  calling_a_function (region, origin, spacing, direction_cosines);

UChar, Char, ...
----------------
The ordering is integers, then float, then vectors; 
    smaller, then larger; unsigned, then signed.

Plm_image, ITK image, Volume
----------------------------
Overloaded functions which return specific types should specify 
them as follows:

     object.get_image ();        // Returns Plm_image::Pointer
     object.get_image_itk ()     // Returns most appropriate itk type
                                 // (usually FloatImageType::Pointer)
     object.get_volume ();       // Returns Volume::Pointer of most 
                                 // appropriate type (usually float) 
     object.get_vol ();          // Returns Volume*

When appropriate, the functions may be suffixed to specify the 
return type:

     object.get_image_itk_float ();
     object.get_volume_float ();


Variable naming for indexing  [Proposed, not implemented]
---------------------------------------------------------
Fixed image voxel                   (f[3]), fidx <currently (fi,fj,fk),fv>
Moving image voxel                  (m[3]), midx < ditto >
    - what about ROI's              ?
    - what about physical coords    ?
Tile (fixed)                        (t[3]), tidx <currently p[3]>
Offset within tile (fixed)          (o[3]), oidx <currently q[3]>
Control point                       (c[3]), cidx <currently (i,j,k), m>
Coefficient array                   ?                <currently cidx>
Multiplier LUT                      qidx
Index LUT                           pidx
