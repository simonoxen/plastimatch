Registration command file reference
-----------------------------------
The registration 
command file uses the "ini file" format.  There are two 
possible sections: GLOBAL, and STAGE.  There should be exactly 
one GLOBAL section, and there can be multiple STAGE sections.

In general, the GLOBAL section defines the input files and 
output files for a single registration.  Each STAGE section 
defines a single processing stage within a registration 
pipeline.  

Global options
==============
The GLOBAL section has only a limited set of allowed parameters.
However, some GLOBAL parameters are also allowed in a STAGE section, 
as noted below.

       which can be used to guide the registration

   * - img_out_fmt
     - GLOBAL, STAGE
     - Output format, which must be either “auto” (default), 
       which means the filename extenstion is used to determine
       the file format, or “dicom”, which interprets img_out 
       as a directory name to output the dicom files
   * - img_out_type
     - GLOBAL, STAGE
     - Data type of the output image.  Either “auto” (default), or 
       an image type string: char, uchar, short, ushort, int, uint, 
       float, or double.

Stage options
=============
Each STAGE section generates a computational stage within a 
computational sequence.  Therefore, a command file with 
three STAGE sections will have three registration stages.
The stages are executed in the same order as they appear in the 
command file.  The registration result from a previous stage 
is passed as the starting point to the next stage.
After all three stages are complete, the output files are generated.

As a general rule, all parameters are optional.  When they are specified, 
they are used.  When they are not specified, they are set automatically.
There are different ways they are automatically set.

* Any parameters not specified in the first stage are given default values.
* Any parameters not specified in subsequent stages are given the 
  same value they had in the previous stage.
* Some parameters can have a value of "auto."  That means the value 
  can be chosen dynamically based on registration inputs 
  or optimization results.

A registration stage is classified according to its transform (xform), 
its implementation, and its optimizer.  Only certain combinations 
are possible, as shown in the following table.

     - vf+demons+itk
     - 0
     - boolean
     - Set the threshold at mean intensity flag. If true, only source
