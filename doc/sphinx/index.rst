Welcome to plastimatch
======================

Plastimatch is an open source software for image computation.  
Our main focus is high-performance 
volumetric registration of medical images, such as 
X-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
and positron emission tomography (PET). Software features include:

* B-spline method for deformable image registration 
  (GPU and multicore accelerated)
* Demons method for deformable image registration 
  (GPU accelerated)
* ITK-based algorithms for translation, rigid, affine,
  demons, and B-spline registration
* Pipelined, multi-stage registration framework with seamless conversion 
  between most algorithms and transform types
* Landmark-based deformable registration using thin-plate splines for 
  global registration
* Landmark-based deformable registration using radial basis functions 
  for local corrections
* Broad support for 3D image file formats (using ITK), including 
  DICOM, Nifti, NRRD, MetaImage, and Analyze
* DICOM and DICOM-RT import and export
* XiO import and export
* Plugin to 3D Slicer

Reg-2-3, included in the plastimatch download, is a full-featured 
2D-3D rigid registration program.  Features include:

* Automatic registration using several cost functions, 
  including 
  normalized mutual information (NMI), 
  normalized correlation (NCC),
  mean reciprocal square differences (MRSD),
  mean squared difference (MS), 
  and gradient difference (GD)
* Interactive initialization
* Programmable pre-processing and post-processing
* Regular and irregular regions of interest

Plastimatch also features two handy utilities which are not
directly related to image registration:

* FDK cone-beam CT reconstruction (GPU and multicore accelerated)
* Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation
  (GPU and multicore accelerated)

Plastimatch lacks the following:

* Landmark-based rigid registration
* Viscous fluid registration
* FEM registration
* Surface matching registration
* 2D-2D registration
