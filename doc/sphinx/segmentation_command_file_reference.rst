Segmentation command file reference
-----------------------------------

The mabs parameter file can have seven sections: PREALIGNMENT, ATLAS-SELECTION, 
TRAINING, REGISTRATION, STRUCTURES, LABELING and OPTIMIZATION_RESULT.
Each section contatins specific entries that can not be mixed.
All the possible parameters are listed below:
