Regularization
==============

The plastimatch B-spline registration algorithm features a 
second derivative regularization term, which can be computed 
either analytically or numerically.  Regularization usually improves 
both accuracy and vector field smoothness, so you are encouraged to 
try it on your problem.

The general form is given as:

.. math::
	c = c_{IM} + \lambda c_{RM}

where :math:`c` is the registration cost that is being optimized.
The cost has two terms: an intensity metric term (:math:`c_{IM}`) and 
a regularization metric term (:math:`c_{RM}`).
The intensity metric penalizes the images that do not match well, 
and the regularization term penalizes vector fields that are not smooth. 
The term :math:`\lambda` is used to trade off between image matching 
and vector field smoothness.  Typical values of :math:`\lambda` 
range between 0.005 and 0.1.

The regularization term used in plastimatch is the square of 
the vector field second derivative.  For a vector field 
:math:`u = (u_x, u_y, u_z)`, the regularization term is given as:

.. math::
	c_{RM} = \int c_{RM,x} + c_{RM,y} + c_{RM,z}

where 

.. math::
	c_{RM,x}
	= \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial x^2} \right)^2
	+ \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial y^2} \right)^2
	+ \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial z^2} \right)^2
	+ \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial x \partial y} \right)^2
	+ \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial x \partial z} \right)^2
	+ \left( \frac{\partial u^2_x}{\partial y \partial z} \right)^2.

The integration is generally defined to be 
performed over the domain of the fixed image.

Analytic regularization
-----------------------
The default choice is to perform analytic regularization.  
Analytic regularization is generally preferred over numeric regularization 
becuase it runs much faster than numeric regularization, and gives 
similar results.  However, it should be noted that the regularization 
is performed over all B-spline tiles that overlap the fixed image, 
which is a slightly larger domain of integration than the numeric methods 
use.

The method works tile by tile.  Each tile is influenced 
by 64 control points, which are formed into a vector :math:`v`.
Or to be more precise, there are 192 control points, three in each 
direction, which are formed into three vectors: 
:math:`v_x`, :math:`v_y`, and :math:`v_z`.  
The smoothness is computed directly from the control points 
using a 64x64 matrix :math:`K`, 
as a quadratic form:

.. math::
	c_{RM} = v_x' K v_x + v_y' K v_y + v_z' K v_z.

The matrix :math:`K` is precomputed, and can be reused for each tile.
The results are then numerically integrated tile-by-tile over the 
fixed image.

Numeric regularization (flavor a)
---------------------------------
Numeric regularization flavor "a" uses finite differencing to compute 
the derivatives, and then numerically integrates these result over all 
voxels.  

Numeric regularization (flavor d)
---------------------------------
Numeric regularization flavor "d" is a mixed analytic-numeric method.  
The derivatives are computed analytically at each voxel, and then 
numerically integrated over all voxels.
