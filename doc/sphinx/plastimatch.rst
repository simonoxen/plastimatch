.. _plastimatch_add:

plastimatch add
---------------
The *add* command is used to add one or more images together and create
an output image.  The contributions of the input images can be weighted
with a weight vector.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch add [options] input_file [input_file ...]
 Options:
   --average        produce an output file which is the average of the
                     input files (if no weights are specified), or
                     multiply the weights by 1/n
   --output <arg>   output image
   --weight <arg>   specify a vector of weights; the images are
                     multiplied by the weight prior to adding their
                     values

Examples
^^^^^^^^
To add together files 01.mha, 02.mha and 03.mha, and save the result
in the file output.mha, you can run the following command::

  plastimatch add --output output.mha 01.mha 02.mha 03.mha

If you wanted output.mha to be 2 * 01.mha + 0.5 * 02.mha + 0.1 * 03.mha,
then you should do this::

  plastimatch add \
    --output output.mha \
    --weight "2 0.5 0.1" \
    01.mha 02.mha 03.mha

.. _plastimatch_adjust:

plastimatch adjust
------------------
The *adjust* command is used to adjust the intensity values
within an image.  The adjustment operations available are truncation, linear
scaling, histogram matching as well as global and local linear matching.

The command line usage is given as follows::

The adjust command can be used to make a piecewise
linear adjustment of
the image intensities.  The --pw-linear option is used to create
the mapping from input intensities to output intensities.
The input intensities in the curve must increase from left to right
in the string, but output intensities are arbitrary.
Input intensities below the first pair or after the last pair
are transformed by extrapolating the curve out to infinity with
a slope of +1.  A different slope may be specified out to
positive or negative infinity by specifying the special
input values of -inf and +inf.  In this case, the
second number in the pair is the slope of the curve, not the
output intensity.  You can do a simplified linear transformation of
gray levels with the --linear option.  For this, you need to
provide a string with "<shift> <scale>".

In addition, you can adjust the image intensities based on a
reference image. With --linear-match, a linear transformation
(shift and scale) is determined from mean and standard deviation
of pixel values in reference and input image. If the input image feaures
local intensity inconsistencies, you can choose a patch-based intensity
correction using the --local-match option.  Similar to --linear-match,
shift and scale are computed patch-wise from mean and standard
deviation.  For both options, you can provide masks that specify the
regions taken into account.  Finally, choose --hist-match to perform
histogram matching.

You can only choose one of --linear, --pw-linear, --linear-match,
--local-match and --hist-match. Beware that a reference filename has to
be added for matching options.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
The following command will add 100 to all voxels in the image::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "0,100"

The following command does the same thing, but with explicit
specification of the slope in the extrapolation area::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "-inf,1,0,100,inf,1"

The following command truncates the inputs to the
range of [-1000,+1000]::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --pw-linear "-inf,0,-1000,-1000,+1000,+1000,inf,0"

The following command scales and then shifts all voxel values by
2.5 and +1000, respectively. (Use either comma or space to separate
the values)::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --linear "1000,2.5"

The following command matches the histogram of infile.nrrd to be
similar to that of reference.nrrd::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --hist-match reference.nrrd \
    --hist-levels 1000 --hist-points 12

The following command matches mean and standard deviation of
intensities in the input image to equal those of the reference image::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --linear-match reference.nrrd

The following command also matches mean and standard deviation,
but calculates statistics only from inside the mask regions
(note that masks are only used for statistic calculations,
you would need to use plastimatch mask to reset outside values)::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --linear-match reference.nrrd \
    --input-mask inmask.nrrd --ref-mask refmask.nrrd

Finally, you can apply patch-wise local intensity adjustment using the
following command::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --local-match reference.nrrd \
    --patch-size "20 20 10"

The --local-match option requires the input and reference to be
spatially aligned.  In order to reduce the influence of background
pixels at the border, you can provide foreground masks for both images
(if only one mask is given, it as also used for the second image)::

  plastimatch adjust \
    --input infile.nrrd
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --local-match reference.nrrd \
    --patch-size "20 20 10" \
    --input-mask inmask.nrrd \
    --ref-mask refmask.nrrd

plastimatch average
-------------------
The *average* command is used to compute the (weighted) average
of multiple input images.  It is the same as the plastimatch *add*
command, with the --average option specified.
Please refer to :ref:`plastimatch_add` for the list of command line
arguments.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command will compute the average of three input images::

  plastimatch average \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    01.mha 02.mha 03.mha

plastimatch autolabel
---------------------
The *autolabel* command is an experimental program the uses machine
learning to identify the thoracic vertibrae in a CT scan.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch autolabel [options]
  Options:
    -h, --help            Display this help message
        --input <arg>     Input image filename (required)
        --network <arg>   Input trained network filename (required)
        --output <arg>    Output csv filename (required)

plastimatch boundary
--------------------
The *boundary* command takes a binary label image as input, and
generates an image of the image boundary as the output.
The boundary is defined as the voxels within the label
which have neighboring voxels outside the label.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch boundary [options] input_file
  Required:
    --output <arg>   filename for output image


plastimatch crop
----------------
The *crop* command crops out a rectangular portion of the input file,
and saves that portion to an output file.
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch crop [options]
  Required:
      --input=image_in
      --output=image_out
      --voxels="x-min x-max y-min y-max z-min z-max" (integers)

The voxels are indexed starting at zero.
In other words, if the size of the image is
:math:`M \times N \times P`,
the x values should range between 0 and :math:`M-1`.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command selects the region of size
:math:`10 \times 10 \times 10`, with the first voxel of the output
image being at location (5,8,12) of the input image::

  plastimatch crop \
    --input in.mha \
    --output out.mha \
    --voxels "5 14 8 17 12 21"

plastimatch compare
-------------------
The *compare* command compares two files by subtracting
one file from the other, and reporting statistics
of the difference image.
The two input files must have the
same geometry (origin, dimensions, and voxel spacing).
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch compare image_in_1 image_in_2

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command subtracts synth_2 from synth_1, and
reports the statistics::

  $ plastimatch compare synth_1.mha synth_2.mha
  MIN -558.201904 AVE 7.769664 MAX 558.680847
  MAE 85.100204 MSE 18945.892578
  DIF 54872 NUM 54872

The reported statistics are interpreted as follows::

  MIN      Minimum value of difference image
  AVE      Average value of difference image
  MAX      Maximum value of difference image
  MAE      Mean average value of difference image
  MSE      Mean squared difference between images
  DIF      Number of pixels with different intensities
  NUM      Total number of voxels in the difference image

plastimatch compose
-------------------
The *compose* command is used to compose two transforms.
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch compose file_1 file_2 outfile

  Note:  file_1 is applied first, and then file_2.
            outfile = file_2 o file_1
            x -> x + file_2(x + file_1(x))

The transforms can be of any type, including translation, rigid, affine,
itk B-spline, native B-spline, or vector fields.
The output file is always a vector field.

There is a further restriction that at least one of the input files
must be either a native B-spline or vector field.  This restriction
is required because that is how the resolution and voxel spacing
of the output vector field is chosen.

Example
^^^^^^^
Suppose we want to compose a rigid transform (rigid.tfm) with a vector field
(vf.mha), such that the output transform is equivalent to applying
the rigid transform first, and the vector field second.
::

  plastimatch compose rigid.tfm vf.mha composed_vf.mha

.. _plastimatch_convert:

plastimatch convert
-------------------
The *convert* command is used to convert files from one
format to another format.  As part of the conversion process, it can
also apply (linear or deformable) geometric transforms
to the input images.  In fact, *convert* is just an alias for the
*warp* command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch convert [options]

Examples
^^^^^^^^
The first example demonstrates how to convert
a DICOM volume to NRRD.  The DICOM images
that comprise the volume must be
stored in a single directory, which for this example
is called "dicom-in-dir".  Because the --output-type option was
not specified,
the output type will be matched to the type of the input DICOM volume.
The format of the output file (NRRD) is determined from the filename
extension. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd

This example further converts the type of the image intensities to float. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-type float

The next example shows how to resample the output image to a different
geometry.  The --origin option sets the position of the
(center of) the first voxel of the image, the --dim option sets the
number of voxels, and the --spacing option sets the
distance between voxels.  The units for origin and spacing are
assumed to be millimeters. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --origin "-200 -200 -165" \
    --dim "250 250 110" \
    --spacing "2 2 2.5"

Generally speaking, it is tedious to manually specify the geometry of
the output file.  If you want to match the geometry of the output
file with an existing file, you can do this using the --fixed option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input dicom-in-dir \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --fixed reference.nrrd

This next example shows how to convert a DICOM RT structure set file
into an image using the --output-ss-img option.
Because structures in DICOM RT are polylines, they are rasterized to
create the image.  The voxels of the output image are 32-bit integers,
where the i^th bit of each integer has value one if the voxel lies with
in the corresponding structure, and value zero if the voxel lies outside the
structure.  The structure names are stored in separate file using
the --output-ss-list option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input structures.dcm \
    --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-ss-list outfile.txt

In the previous example, the geometry of the output file wasn't specified.
When the geometry of a DICOM RT structure set isn't specified, it is
assumed to match the geometry of the DICOM (CT, MR, etc)
image associated with the
contours.  If the associated DICOM image is in the same directory as
the structure set file, it will be found automatically.  Otherwise, we
have to tell plastimatch where it is located with the --referenced-ct option. ::

  plastimatch convert \
    --input structures.dcm \
    --output-ss-img outfile.nrrd \
    --output-ss-list outfile.txt \
    --referenced-ct ../image-directory


plastimatch dice
----------------
The plastimatch *dice* compares binary label images using Dice coefficient,
Hausdorff distance, or contour mean distance.  The input images are
treated as boolean, where non-zero values mean that voxel is inside
of the structure and zero values mean that the voxel is outside
of the structure.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch dice [options] reference-image test-image
 Options:
  --all            Compute Dice, Hausdorff, and contour mean
                    distance (equivalent to --dice --hausdorff
                    --contour-mean)
  --contour-mean   Compute contour mean distance
  --dice           Compute Dice coefficient (default)
  --hausdorff      Compute Hausdorff distance and average Hausdorff
                    distance

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes all three statistics for mask1.mha
and mask2.mha::

  plastimatch dice --all mask1.mha mask2.mha


plastimatch diff
----------------
The plastimatch *diff* command subtracts one image from another, and saves
the output as a new image.
The two input files must have the
same geometry (origin, dimensions, and voxel spacing).

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch diff image_in_1 image_in_2 image_out

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes file1.nrrd minus file2.nrrd, and saves
the result in outfile.nrrd::

  plastimatch diff file1.nrrd file2.nrrd outfile.nrrd


plastimatch dmap
----------------
The plastimatch *dmap* command takes a binary label image as input,
and creates a distance map image as the output.
The output image has the
same image geometry (origin, dimensions, voxel spacing) as the
input image.

The command line usage is given as follows::


 Usage: plastimatch dmap [options]
 Required:
  --input <arg>        input directory or filename
  --output <arg>       output image

                        (default is "danielsson")
  --inside-positive    voxels inside the structure should be
                        positive (by default they are negative)
  --maximum-distance <arg>
                       voxels with distances greater than this
                        number will have the distance truncated to
                        this number
  --squared-distance   return the squared distance instead of
                        distance


Example
^^^^^^^
The following command computes a distance map file dmap.nrrd
from a binary labelmap image label.nrrd.::

  plastimatch dmap --input label.nrrd --output dmap.nrrd


plastimatch drr
---------------
A digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) is a synthetic radiograph 
which can be generated from a computed tomography (CT) scan.  
It is used as a reference image for verifying the correct setup 
position of a patient prior to radiation treatment.  

The drr program that comes with plastimatch takes a CT image 
as input, and generates one or more output images.

      --vup <arg>               The vector pointing from the detector 
                                 center to the top row of the detector in
                                 format "x y z" 

An input file is required.  
The drr program can be used in either 
*single image mode* or *rotational mode*.  In single image mode, 
you specify the complete geometry of the x-ray source and imaging 
panel for a single image.  In rotational mode, the imaging geometry 
is rotated in a circular arc around the isocenter, with a fixed
source to axis distance (SAD), and projection images generated
at fixed angular intervals.


Examples
^^^^^^^^
The following example illustrates the use of single image mode::

  drr -nrm "1 0 0" \
      -vup "0 0 1" \
      -g "1000 1500" \
      -r "1024 768" \
      -z "400 300" \
      -c "383.5 511.5" \
      -o "0 -20 -50" \
      input_file.mha

In the above example, the isocenter is chosen to be 
(0, -20, -50), the location marked on the 
CT image.  The orientation of the projection image is controlled by 
the **nrm** and **vup** options.  Using the default values of (1, 0, 0) 
and (0, 0, 1) yields the DRR shown on the right:

.. image:: ../figures/drr_input.png
   :width: 45 %
.. image:: ../figures/drr_output_1.png
   :width: 31 %

By changing the normal direction (**nrm**), we can choose different 
beam direction within an isocentric orbit.  For example, an 
anterior-posterior (AP) DRR is generated with a normal of (0, -1, 0) 
as shown below:

.. image:: ../figures/drr_output_2.png
   :width: 31 %

The rotation of the imaging panel is selected using the **vup** option.
The default value of **vup** is (0, 0, 1), which means that the top 
of the panel is oriented toward the positive z direction in world 
coordinates.  If we wanted to rotate the panel by 45 degrees 
counter-clockwise on our AP view, we would set **vup** to 
the (1, 0, 1) direction, as shown in the image below.  
Note that **vup** doesn't have to be normalized.

.. image:: ../figures/drr_output_3.png
   :width: 31 %

In rotional mode, multiple images are created.  The source and imaging 
panel are assumed to rotate in a circular orbit around the isocenter.  
The circular orbit is performed around the Z axis, and the images 
are generated every **-N ang** degrees of the orbit.  This is illustrated 
using the following example::

  drr -N 20 \
      -a 18 \
      -g "1000 1500" \
      -r "1024 768" \
      -z "400 300" \
      -o "0 -20 -50" \
      input_file.mha

In the above example, 18 images are generated at a 20 degree interval, 
as follows:

.. image:: ../figures/drr_output_4.png
   :width: 70 %


plastimatch dvh
---------------
The *dvh* command creates a dose value histogram (DVH)
from a given dose image and structure set image.
The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch dvh [options]
 Options:
      --bin-width <arg>       specify bin width in the histogram in 
                               units of Gy (default=0.5) 
      --cumulative            create a cumulative DVH (this is the 
                               default) 
      --differential          create a differential DVH instead of a 
                               cumulative DVH 
      --dose-units <arg>      specify units of dose in input file as 
                               either cGy as "cgy" or Gy as "gy" 
                               (default="gy") 
  -h, --help                  display this help message 
      --input-dose <arg>      dose image file 
      --input-ss-img <arg>    structure set image file 
      --input-ss-list <arg>   structure set list file containing names 
                               and colors 
      --normalization <arg>   specify histogram values as either voxels 
                               "vox" or percent "pct" (default="pct") 
      --num-bins <arg>        specify number of bins in the histogram 
                               (default=256) 
      --output-csv <arg>      file to save dose volume histogram data in
                               csv format 
      --version               display the program version 

The required inputs are
--input-dose,
--input-ss-img, --input-ss-list,
and --output-csv.
The units of the input dose must be either Gy or cGy.
DVH bin values will be generated for all structures found in the
structure set files.  The output will be generated as an ASCII
csv-format spreadsheet file, readable by OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Excel.

The default is a differential (standard) histogram, rather than the
cumulative DVH which is most common in radiotherapy.  To create a cumulative
DVH, use the --cumulative option.

The default is to create 256 bins, each with a width of 1 Gy.
You can adjust these values using the --num-bins and --bin-width option.

Example
^^^^^^^
To generate a DVH for a single 2 Gy fraction, we might choose 250 bins each of
width 1 cGy.  If the input dose is already specified in cGy, you would
use the following command::

  plastimatch dvh \
    --input-ss-img structures.mha \
    --input-ss-list structures.txt \
    --input-dose dose.mha \
    --output-csv dvh.csv \
    --input-units cgy \
    --num-bins 250 \
    --bin-width 1


plastimatch fdk
---------------
The term FDK refers to the authors 
Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress who wrote the seminal paper 
"Practical cone-beam algorithm" in 1984.  Their paper 
describes a filtered back-projection reconstruction algorithm 
for cone-beam geometries.  The fdk program in plastimatch is 
an implmenetation of the FDK algorithm.
It takes a directory of 2D projection images as input, and 
generates a single 3D volume as output.  

The command line usage is::

 Usage: plastimatch fdk [options]
 Options:
  -x, --detector-offset <arg>   The translational offset of the detector
                                 "x0 y0", in pixels 
  -r, --dim <arg>               The output image resolution in voxels 
                                 "num (num num)" (default: 256 256 100 
  -f, --filter <arg>            Choice of filter {none,ramp} (default: 
                                 ramp) 
  -X, --flavor <arg>            Implementation flavor {0,a,b,c,d} 
                                 (default: c) 
  -h, --help                    display this help message 
  -a, --image-range <arg>       Use a sub-range of available images 
                                 "first ((skip) last)" 
  -I, --input <arg>             Input file 
  -s, --intensity-scale <arg>   Scaling factor for output image 
                                 intensity 
  -O, --output <arg>            Prefix for output file(s) 
  -A, --threading <arg>         Threading option {cpu,cuda,opencl} 
                                 (default: cpu) 
      --version                 display the program version 
  -z, --volume-size <arg>       Physical size of reconstruction volume 
                                 "s1 s2 s3", in mm (default: 300 300 150) 

The usage of the fdk program is best understood by following along 
with the tutorials: :ref:`fdk_tutorial_i` and :ref:`fdk_tutorial_ii`.

Three different formats of input files are supported.  These are:

- Pfm format image files with geometry txt files
- Raw format image files with geometry txt files
- Varian hnd files

The pfm and raw files are similar, in that they store the image as 
an array of 4-byte little-endian floats.  The only difference is that 
the pfm file has a header which stores the image size, and the raw file 
does not.

Each pfm or raw image file must have a geometry file in the same directory 
with the .txt extension.  For example, if you want to use image_0000.pfm
in a reconstruction, you should supply another file image_0000.txt 
which contains the geometry.  
A brief description of the geometry file format is given in 
:ref:`proj_mat_file_format`.

The sequence of files should be stored with the pattern:

  XXXXYYYY.ZZZ

where XXXX is a prefix, YYYY is a number, and .ZZZ is the extension 
of a known type (either .hnd, .pfm, or .raw).

For example the following would be a good directory layout for pfm files::

  Files/image_00.pfm
  Files/image_00.txt
  Files/image_01.pfm
  Files/image_01.txt
  etc...

The Varian hnd files should be stored in the original layout.  For example::

  Files/ProjectionInfo.xml
  Files/Scan0/Proj_0000.hnd
  Files/Scan0/Proj_0001.hnd
  etc...

No geometry txt files are needed to reconstruct from Varian hnd format.

By default, when you generate a DRR, the image is oriented as if the
virtual x-ray source were a camera.  That means that for a right
lateral film, the columns of the image go from inf to sup, and the
rows go from ant to post.  The Varian OBI system produces HND files,
which are oriented differently. For a right lateral film, the columns
of the HND images go from ant to post, and the rows go from sup to
inf.  An illustration of this idea is shown in the figure below. 

.. figure:: ../figures/cbct_geometry.png
   :width: 60 %

plastimatch fill
----------------
The *fill* command is used to fill an image region with a constant
intensity.  The region filled is defined by a mask file,
with voxels with non-zero intensity in the mask image being filled.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch fill [options]
 Options:
   --input <arg>         input directory or filename; can be an image
                          or dicom directory
   --mask <arg>          input filename for mask image
   --mask-value <arg>    value to set for pixels within mask (for
                          "fill"), or outside of mask (for "mask"
   --output <arg>        output filename (for image file) or directory
                          (for dicom)
   --output-format <arg> arg should be "dicom" for dicom output
   --output-type <arg>   type of output image, one of {uchar, short,
                          float, ...}

Examples
^^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a file prostate.nrrd which is zero outside of the
prostate, and non-zero inside of the prostate.
We can fill the prostate with an intensity of 1000, while
leaving non-prostate areas with their original intensity, using
the following command. ::

  plastimatch fill \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --mask-value 1000 \
    --mask prostate.nrrd


plastimatch filter
------------------
The *filter* command applies a filter to an input image,
and creates a filtered image as its output.
The filter can be either built-in, or custom.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch filter [options] input_image
 Options:
  --gabor-k-fib <arg>     choose gabor direction at index i within
                           fibonacci spiral of length n; specified as
                           "i n" where i and n are integers, and i is
                           between 0 and n-1
  --gauss-width <arg>     the width (in mm) of a uniform Gaussian
                           smoothing filter
  --kernel <arg>          kernel image filename
  --output <arg>          output image filename
  --output-kernel <arg>   output kernel filename
  --pattern <arg>         filter type: {gabor, gauss, kernel},
                           default is gauss

The built-in filters supported are "gabor" and "gauss".
For a Gaussian, the width of the Gaussian can be controlled
using the --gauss-width option.
The Gabor filter is currently limited to automatic selection of
filter directions, which are spaced quasi-uniformly on the
unit sphere.
Custom filters are specified by supplying a kernel file,
which is convolved with the image.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command will generate a filtered image from the
first gabor filter within a bank of 10 filters.::

  plastimatch filter --pattern gabor Testing/rect-1.mha \
    --gabor-k-fib "0 5" --output g-05.mha

plastimatch gamma
-----------------
The *gamma* command compares two images using the so-called
gamma criterion.  The gamma criterion specifies that
images are similar at a givel location within a reference
image if there exists a voxel with similar intensity
nearby in the comparison image.
Both local gamma and global gamma can be performed
using this command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch gamma [options] image_1 image_2
 Options:
  --analysis-threshold <arg>
      Analysis threshold for dose in float (for
       example, input 0.1 to apply 10% of the
       reference dose). The final threshold dose
       (Gy) is calculated by multiplying this
       value and a given reference dose (or
       maximum dose if not given). (default is
       0.1)
  --compute-full-region    With this option, full gamma map will be
       generated over the entire image region
       (even for low-dose region). It is
       recommended not to use this option to
       speed up the computation. It has no
       effect on gamma pass-rate.
  --dose-tolerance <arg>   The scaling coefficient for dose
       difference. (e.g. put 0.02 if you want to
       apply 2% dose difference criterion)
       (default is 0.03)
  --dta-tolerance <arg>    The distance-to-agreement (DTA) scaling
       coefficient in mm (default is 3)
  --gamma-max <arg>        The maximum value of gamma to compute;
       smaller values run faster (default is
       2.0)
  --inherent-resample <arg>
      Spacing value in [mm]. The reference
       image itself will be resampled by this
       value (Note: resampling compare-image to
       ref-image is inherent already). If arg <
       0, this option is disabled. (default is
       -1.0)
  --interp-search          With this option, smart interpolation
       search will be used in points near the
       reference point. This will eliminate the
       needs of fine resampling. However, it
       will take longer time to compute.
  --local-gamma            With this option, dose difference is
       calculated based on local dose
       difference. Otherwise, a given reference
       dose will be used, which is called
       global-gamma.
  --output <arg>           Output image
  --output-failmap <arg>   File path for binary gamma evaluation
       result.
  --output-text <arg>      Text file path for gamma evaluation
       result.

       compute dose tolerance; if not specified,
       then maximum dose in reference volume is
       used
  --resample-nn            With this option, Nearest Neighbor will
       be used instead of linear interpolation
       in resampling the compare-image to the
       reference image. Not recommended for
       better results.


Example
^^^^^^^
A gamma image is produced from two input images using the default
parameters.  This will be a global gamma, using maximum intensity
of the reference image as the gamma normalization value.::

 plastimatch gamma --output gamma.mha \
   reference-image.mha compare-image.mha


plastimatch header
------------------
The *header* command is used to display simple properties about
the volume, such as the image data type and image geometry.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch header [options] input_file [input_file ...]
 Options:
  -h, --help      display this help message
      --version   display the program version

Example
^^^^^^^
We can display the geometry of any supported file type,
such as mha, nrrd,
or dicom.  We can run the command as follows::

  $ plastimatch header input.mha
  Type = float
  Planes = 1
  Origin = -180 -180 -167.75
  Size = 512 512 120
  Spacing = 0.7031 0.7031 2.5
  Direction = 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1

From the header information, we see that the image has 120 slices,
and each slice is 512 x 512 pixels.  The slice spacing is 2.5 mm,
and the in-plane pixel spacing is 0.7031 mm.


plastimatch jacobian
--------------------
The *jacobian* command computes the Jacobian determinant

      -a=wendland	Wendland RBFs with compact support (for 
                         local registration)

In the case of Wendland RBFs "-r" option sets the radius of support.

Regularization of vector field is available for "gauss" and "wendland"
algorithms. To regularize the output vector field increase
"-Y" to '0.1' and up with increment '0.1'.

Example
^^^^^^^
To create a vector field from coresponding landmarks in fixed.fcsv
and moving.fcs using Gaussian radial basis functions,
do the following::

  plastimatch lm-warp \
      --output-vf vf.nrrd \
      --fixed-landmarks fixed.fcsv --moving-landmarks moving.fcsv

plastimatch mabs

file, and you must arrange your training data into the proper
directory format.
For a complete description of the command file syntax and
usage examples, please refer to the :ref:`mabs_guidebook`
and the :ref:`segmentation_command_file_reference`.

plastimatch mask
----------------
The *mask* command is used to fill an image region with a constant
intensity.  The region filled is defined by a mask file,
with voxels with zero intensity in the mask image being filled.
Thus, it is the inverse of the *fill* command.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch mask [options]
 Options:
   --input <arg>           input directory or filename; can be an
                            image or dicom directory
   --mask <arg>            input filename for mask image
   --mask-value <arg>      value to set for pixels within mask (for
                            "fill"), or outside of mask (for "mask"
   --output <arg>          output filename (for image file) or
                            directory (for dicom)

   --output-type <arg>     type of output image, one of {uchar, short,
                            float, ...}

Examples
^^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a file called patient.nrrd,
which is zero outside of the patient, and
non-zero inside the patient.
If we want to fill in the area
outside of the patient with value -1000, we use the following command. ::

  plastimatch mask \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --negate-mask \
    --mask-value -1000 \
    --mask patient.nrrd


plastimatch ml-convert
----------------------
To be written.


plastimatch probe
-----------------
The plastimatch *probe* command is used to examine the image intensity
or vector field displacement at one or more positions within a volume.
The probe positions can be specified in world coordinates (in mm), using
the --location option, or as image indices using the --index option.
The locations or indices are linearly interpolated if they lie between
voxels.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch probe [options] file
 Options:
  -i, --index <arg>      List of voxel indices, such as
                          "i j k;i j k;..."
  -l, --location <arg>   List of spatial locations, such as
                          "i j k;i j k;..."

The command will output one line for each probe requested.
Each output line includes the following fields.::

  PROBE#        The probe number, starting with zero
  INDEX         The (fractional) position of the probe as a voxel index
  LOC           The position of the probe in world coordinates
  VALUE         The intensity (for volumes) or displacement
                 (for vector fields)

Example
^^^^^^^
We use the index option to see an image intensity at coordinate (2,3,4),
and the location option to see image intensities at two different
locations::

  plastimatch probe \
     --index "2 3 4" \
     --location "0 0 0; 0.5 0.5 0.5" \
     infile.nrrd

The output will include three probe results.  Each probe shows the
probe index, voxel index, voxel location, and intensity. ::

  0:    2.00,    3.00,    4.00;  -22.37,  -21.05,  -19.74; -998.725891
  1:   19.00,   19.00,   19.00;    0.00,    0.00,    0.00; -0.000197
  2:   19.38,   19.38,   19.38;    0.50,    0.50,    0.50; -9.793450

plastimatch register
--------------------
The plastimatch *register* command is used to peform linear or deformable
registration of two images.
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch register command_file

The command file is an ordinary text file, which contains a single
global section and one or more stages sections.
The global section begins with a line containing only the string "[GLOBAL]",
and each stage begins with a line containing the string "[STAGE]".

The global section is used to set input files, output files, and
global parameters, while the each stage section defines a sequential
stage of processing.  For a complete description of the command file
syntax, please refer to the :ref:`registration_command_file_reference`.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. include:: image_registration_quick_start.rst

For more examples, please refer to the :ref:`image_registration_guidebook`.

plastimatch resample

                               preset value,
                               {identity,rotated-{1,2,3},sheared}, or 9 digit
                               matrix string "a b c d e f g h i"
  -F, --fixed <arg>           fixed image (match output size to this image)

      --input <arg>           input directory or filename; can be an image or
                               vector field
      --interpolation <arg>   interpolation type, either "nn" or "linear",
                               default is linear
      --origin <arg>          location of first image voxel in mm "x y z"

      --version               display the program version

Example
^^^^^^^
We can use the --subsample option to bin an integer number of voxels
to a single voxel.  So for example, if we want to bin a cube of size
3x3x1 voxels to a single voxel, we would do the following. ::

  plastimatch resample \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output outfile.nrrd \
    --subsample "3 3 1"

plastimatch scale
-----------------
The *scale* command scales an image or vector field by multiplying
each voxel by a constant value.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch scale [options] input_file
 Options:
   --output <arg>   filename for output image or vector field
   --weight <arg>   scale the input image or vector field by this
                     value (float)

Example

This command creates an output file with image intensity (or voxel
length) twice as large as the input values::

 plastimatch scale --output output.mha --weight 2.0 input.mha


plastimatch segment
-------------------
The *segment* command does simple threshold-based semgentation.
The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch segment [options]
  Options:
    -h, --help                    Display this help message

        --output-img <arg>        Output image filename
        --upper-threshold <arg>   Upper threshold (include voxels
                                   below this value)

Example
^^^^^^^
Suppose we have a CT image of a water tank, and we wish to create an image
which has ones where there is water, and zeros where there is air.
Then we could do this::

  plastimatch segment \
    --input water.mha \
    --output-img water-label.mha \
    --lower-threshold -500

If we wanted instead to create a DICOM-RT structure set, we should
specify a DICOM image as the input.  This will allow plastimatch to
create the DICOM-RT with the correct patient name, patient id, and UIDs.
The output file will be called "ss.dcm".
::

  plastimatch segment \
    --input water_dicom \
    --output-dicom water_dicom \
    --lower-threshold -500


plastimatch stats
-----------------
The plastimatch stats command displays a few basic statistics about the
image onto the screen.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch stats file [file ...]

The input files can be either 2D projection images, 3D volumes, or
3D vector fields.

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command displays statistics for the 3D volume synth_1.mha. ::

  $ plastimatch stats synth_1.mha
  MIN -999.915161 AVE -878.686035 MAX 0.000000 NUM 54872

The reported statistics are interpreted as follows::

  MIN      Minimum intensity in image
  AVE      Average intensity in image
  MAX      Maximum intensity in image
  NUM      Number of voxels in image

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command displays statistics for the 3D vector field vf.mha::

  $ plastimatch stats vf.mha
  Min:            0.000     -0.119     -0.119
  Mean:          13.200      0.593      0.593
  Max:           21.250      1.488      1.488
  Mean abs:      13.200      0.594      0.594
  Energy: MINDIL -6.79 MAXDIL 0.166 MAXSTRAIN 41.576 TOTSTRAIN 70849
  Min dilation at: (29 19 19)
  Jacobian: MINJAC -6.32835 MAXJAC 1.15443 MINABSJAC 0.360538
  Min abs jacobian at: (28 36 36)
  Second derivatives: MINSECDER 0 MAXSECDER 388.82 TOTSECDER 669219
    INTSECDER 1.524e+06
  Max second derivative: (29 36 36)

The rows corresponding to "Min, Mean, Max, and Mean abs" each
have three numbers, which correspond to the x, y, and z coordinates.
Therefore, they compute these statistics for each vector direction
separately.

The remaining statistics are described as follows::

  MINDIL        Minimum dilation
  MAXDIL        Maximum dilation
  MAXSTRAIN     Maximum strain
  TOTSTRAIN     Total strain
  MINJAC        Minimum Jacobian
  MAXJAC        Maximum Jacobian
  MINABSJAC     Minimum absolute Jacobian
  MINSECDER     Minimum second derivative
  MAXSECDER     Maximum second derivative
  TOTSECDER     Total second derivative
  INTSECDER     Integral second derivative


plastimatch synth
-----------------
The *synth* command creates a synthetic image.  The following kinds
of images can be created, by specifying the appropriate --pattern option.
Each of these patterns come with a synthetic structure set and
synthetic dose which can be used for testing.

- donut -- a donut shaped structure
- gauss -- a Gaussian blur
- grid -- a 3D grid
- lung -- a synthetic lung with a tumor
- rect -- a uniform rectangle within a uniform background

                        high
      --version        display the program version

Example
^^^^^^^

   --input input_image.nrrd \
   --output output_labe.nrrd \
   --range "100,200"


plastimatch thumbnail
---------------------
The *thumbnail* command generates a two-dimensional thumbnail image of an
axial slice of the input volume.  The output image
is not required to correspond exactly to an integer slice number.
The location of the output image within the slice is always centered.

The command line usage is given as follows::

  Usage: plastimatch thumbnail [options] input-file
  Options:
    --input file
    --output file
    --thumbnail-dim size
    --thumbnail-spacing size
    --slice-loc location

Example
^^^^^^^
We create a two-dimensional image with resolution 10 x 10 pixels,
at axial location 0, and of size 20 x 20 mm::

  plastimatch thumbnail \
    --input in.mha --output out.mha \
    --thumbnail-dim 10 \
    --thumbnail-spacing 2 \
    --slice-loc 0


plastimatch union
-----------------
The *union* command creates a binary volume which is the
logical union of two input images.  Voxels in the output
image have
value one if the voxel is non-zero in either input image,
or value zero if the voxel is zero in both input images.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch union [options] input_1 input_2
 Options:
  -h, --help           display this help message
      --output <arg>   filename for output image
      --version        display the program version

Example
^^^^^^^
The following command creates a volume that is the
union of two input images::

 plastimatch union \
   --output itv.mha \
   phase_1.mha phase_2.mha


plastimatch warp
----------------
The *warp* command is an alias for *convert*.
Please refer to :ref:`plastimatch_convert` for the list
of command line parameters.

Examples
^^^^^^^^
To warp an image using the B-spline coefficients generated by the
plastimatch register command (saved in the file bspline.txt), do the
following::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt

In the previous example, the output file geometry was determined by the
geometry information in the bspline coefficient file.  You can resample
to a different geometry using --fixed, or --origin, --dim, and --spacing. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --fixed reference.nrrd

When warping a structure set image, where the integer bits correspond to
structure membership, you need to use nearest neighbor interpolation
rather than linear interpolation. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input structures-in.nrrd \
    --output-img structures-out.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --interpolation nn

Sometimes, voxels located outside of the geometry of the input image
will be warped into the geometry of the output image.  By default, these
areas are "filled in" with an intensity of zero.  You can choose a different
value for these areas using the --default-value option. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input infile.nrrd \
    --output-img outfile.nrrd \
    --xf bspline.txt \
    --default-value -1000

In addition to images and structures, landmarks exported from 3D Slicer can
also be warped. ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \
    --output-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \
    --xf bspline.txt

Sometimes, it may be desirable to apply a transform explicitly defined by a
vector field instead of using B-spline coefficients.  To allow this, the --xf
option also accepts vector field volumes.  For example, the previous example
would become.  ::

  plastimatch warp \
    --input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \
    --output-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \
    --xf vf.mha


plastimatch xf-convert
----------------------
The *xf-convert* command converts between transform types.
A transform can be either a B-spline transform, or a vector field.
There are two different kinds of B-spline transform formats:
the plastimatch native format, and the ITK format.
In addition to converting the transform type, the *xf-convert* command
can also change the grid-spacing of B-spline transforms.

The command line usage is given as follows::

 Usage: plastimatch xf-convert [options]
 Options:
   --dim <arg>            Size of output image in voxels "x [y z]"
   --grid-spacing <arg>   B-spline grid spacing in mm "x [y z]"
   --input <arg>          Input xform filename (required)
   --nobulk               Omit bulk transform for itk_bspline
   --origin <arg>         Location of first image voxel in mm "x y z"
   --output <arg>         Output xform filename (required)
   --output-type <arg>    Type of xform to create (required), choose
                           from {bspline, itk_bspline, vf}
   --spacing <arg>        Voxel spacing in mm "x [y z]"

Example
^^^^^^^
We want to convert a B-spline transform into a vector field.  If the
B-spline transform is in native-format, the vector field
geometry is defined by the values found in the transform header.::

  plastimatch xf-convert \
    --input bspline.txt \
    --output vf.mha \
    --output-type vf

Likewise, if we want to convert a vector field into a set of B-spline
coefficients with a control-point spacing of 30 mm in each direction. ::

  plastimatch xf-convert \
    --input vf.mha \
    --output bspline.txt \
    --output-type bspline \
    --grid-spacing 30
