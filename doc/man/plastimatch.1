.SH PLASTIMATCH ADD
.sp
The \fIadd\fP command is used to add one or more images together and create
an output image.  The contributions of the input images can be weighted
with a weight vector.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch add [options] input_file [input_file ...]
Options:
  \-\-average        produce an output file which is the average of the
                    input files (if no weights are specified), or
                    multiply the weights by 1/n
  \-\-output <arg>   output image
  \-\-weight <arg>   specify a vector of weights; the images are
                    multiplied by the weight prior to adding their
                    values
.ft P
.fi
.SS Examples
.sp
To add together files 01.mha, 02.mha and 03.mha, and save the result
in the file output.mha, you can run the following command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch add \-\-output output.mha 01.mha 02.mha 03.mha
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If you wanted output.mha to be 2 * 01.mha + 0.5 * 02.mha + 0.1 * 03.mha,
then you should do this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch add \e
  \-\-output output.mha \e
  \-\-weight "2 0.5 0.1" \e
  01.mha 02.mha 03.mha
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH ADJUST
.sp
The \fIadjust\fP command is used to adjust the intensity values
within an image.  The adjustment operations available are truncation and
linear scaling.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch adjust [options]
Required:
    \-\-input <arg>       input directory or filename
    \-\-output <arg>      output image
Optional:
    \-\-pw\-linear <arg>   a string that forms a piecewise linear map from
                         input values to output values, of the form
                         "in1,out1,in2,out2,..."
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The adjust command can be used to make a piecewise linear adjustment of
the image intensities.  The \-\-pw\-linear option is used to create
the mapping from input intensities to output intensities.
The input intensities in the curve must increase from left to right
in the string, but output intensities are arbitrary.
.sp
Input intensities below the first pair or after the last pair
are transformed by extrapolating the curve out to infinity with
a slope of +1.  A different slope may be specified out to
positive or negative infinity by specifying the special
input values of \-inf and +inf.  In this case, the
second number in the pair is the slope of the curve, not the
output intensity.
.SS Examples
.sp
The following command will add 100 to all voxels in the image:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch adjust \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-pw\-linear "0,100"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The following command does the same thing, but with explicit
specification of the slope in the extrapolation area:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch adjust \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-pw\-linear "\-inf,1,0,100,inf,1"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The following command truncates the inputs to the
range of [\-1000,+1000]:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch adjust \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-pw\-linear "\-inf,0,\-1000,\-1000,+1000,+1000,inf,0"
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH AVERAGE
.sp
The \fIaverage\fP command is used to compute the (weighted) average
of multiple input images.  It is the same as the plastimatch \fIadd\fP
command, with the \-\-average option specified.
Please refer to \fI\%plastimatch add\fP for the list of command line
arguments.
.SS Example
.sp
The following command will compute the average of three input images:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch average \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  01.mha 02.mha 0.3.mha
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH AUTOLABEL
.sp
The \fIautolabel\fP command is an experimental program the uses machine
learning to identify the thoracic vertibrae in a CT scan.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch autolabel [options]
Options:
  \-h, \-\-help            Display this help message
      \-\-input <arg>     Input image filename (required)
      \-\-network <arg>   Input trained network filename (required)
      \-\-output <arg>    Output csv filename (required)
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH CROP
.sp
The \fIcrop\fP command crops out a rectangular portion of the input file,
and saves that portion to an output file.
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch crop [options]
Required:
    \-\-input=image_in
    \-\-output=image_out
    \-\-voxels="x\-min x\-max y\-min y\-max z\-min z\-max" (integers)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The voxels are indexed starting at zero.
In other words, if the size of the image is
M \times N \times P,
the x values should range between 0 and M-1.
.SS Example
.sp
The following command selects the region of size
10 \times 10 \times 10, with the first voxel of the output
image being at location (5,8,12) of the input image:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch crop \e
  \-\-input in.mha \e
  \-\-output out.mha \e
  \-\-voxels "5 14 8 17 12 21"
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH COMPARE
.sp
The \fIcompare\fP command compares two files by subtracting
one file from the other, and reporting statistics
of the difference image.
The two input files must have the
same geometry (origin, dimensions, and voxel spacing).
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch compare image_in_1 image_in_2
.ft P
.fi
.SS Example
.sp
The following command subtracts synth_2 from synth_1, and
reports the statistics:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ plastimatch compare synth_1.mha synth_2.mha
MIN \-558.201904 AVE 7.769664 MAX 558.680847
MAE 85.100204 MSE 18945.892578
DIF 54872 NUM 54872
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The reported statistics are interpreted as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
MIN      Minimum value of difference image
AVE      Average value of difference image
MAX      Maximum value of difference image
MAE      Mean average value of difference image
MSE      Mean squared difference between images
DIF      Number of pixels with different intensities
NUM      Total number of voxels in the difference image
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH COMPOSE
.sp
The \fIcompose\fP command is used to compose two transforms.
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch compose file_1 file_2 outfile

Note:  file_1 is applied first, and then file_2.
          outfile = file_2 o file_1
          x \-> x + file_2(x + file_1(x))
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The transforms can be of any type, including translation, rigid, affine,
itk B\-spline, native B\-spline, or vector fields.
The output file is always a vector field.
.sp
There is a further restriction that at least one of the input files
must be either a native B\-spline or vector field.  This restriction
is required because that is how the resolution and voxel spacing
of the output vector field is chosen.
.SS Example
.sp
Suppose we want to compose a rigid transform (rigid.tfm) with a vector field
(vf.mha), such that the output transform is equivalent to applying
the rigid transform first, and the vector field second.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch compose rigid.tfm vf.mha composed_vf.mha
.ft P
.fi
.SH PLASTIMATCH CONVERT
.sp
The \fIconvert\fP command is used to convert files from one
format to another format.  As part of the conversion process, it can
also apply (linear or deformable) geometric transforms
to the input images.  In fact, \fIconvert\fP is just an alias for the
\fIwarp\fP command.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch convert [options]

.SS Examples
.sp
The first example demonstrates how to convert
a DICOM volume to NRRD.  The DICOM images
that comprise the volume must be
stored in a single directory, which for this example
is called "dicom\-in\-dir".  Because the \-\-output\-type option was
not specified,
the output type will be matched to the type of the input DICOM volume.
The format of the output file (NRRD) is determined from the filename
extension.

The next example shows how to resample the output image to a different
geometry.  The \-\-origin option sets the position of the
(center of) the first voxel of the image, the \-\-dim option sets the
number of voxels, and the \-\-spacing option sets the
distance between voxels.  The units for origin and spacing are
assumed to be millimeters.
.sp

Generally speaking, it is tedious to manually specify the geometry of
the output file.  If you want to match the geometry of the output
file with an existing file, you can do this using the \-\-fixed option.

.sp
This next example shows how to convert a DICOM RT structure set file
into an image using the \-\-output\-ss\-img option.
Because structures in DICOM RT are polylines, they are rasterized to
create the image.  The voxels of the output image are 32\-bit integers,
where the i^th bit of each integer has value one if the voxel lies with
in the corresponding structure, and value zero if the voxel lies outside the
structure.  The structure names are stored in separate file using
the \-\-output\-ss\-list option.
.sp

plastimatch convert \e

.sp
In the previous example, the geometry of the output file wasn\(aqt specified.
When the geometry of a DICOM RT structure set isn\(aqt specified, it is
assumed to match the geometry of the DICOM CT image associated with the
contours.  If the associated DICOM CT image is in the same directory as
the structure set file, it will be found automatically.  Otherwise, we
have to tell plastimatch where it is located with the \-\-dicom\-dir option.

.SH PLASTIMATCH DICE
.sp
The plastimatch \fIdice\fP compares binary volumes using Dice coefficient,
Hausdorff distance, or contour mean distance.  The input images are
treated as boolean, where non\-zero values mean that voxel is inside
of the structure and zero values mean that the voxel is outside
of the structure.

.SH PLASTIMATCH DIFF
.sp
The plastimatch \fIdiff\fP command subtracts one image from another, and saves

.SH PLASTIMATCH DVH
.sp
The \fIdvh\fP command creates a dose value histogram (DVH)
from a given dose image and structure set image.
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp

.ft C
Usage: plastimatch dvh [options]
   \-\-input\-ss\-img file

   \-\-input\-units {gy,cgy}
   \-\-cumulative
   \-\-num\-bins
   \-\-bin\-width
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The required inputs are
\-\-input\-dose,
\-\-input\-ss\-img, \-\-input\-ss\-list,
and \-\-output\-csv.
The units of the input dose must be either Gy or cGy.
DVH bin values will be generated for all structures found in the
structure set files.  The output will be generated as an ASCII
csv\-format spreadsheet file, readable by OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Excel.
.sp
The default is a differential (standard) histogram, rather than the
cumulative DVH which is most common in radiotherapy.  To create a cumulative
DVH, use the \-\-cumulative option.
.sp
The default is to create 256 bins, each with a width of 1 Gy.
You can adjust these values using the \-\-num\-bins and \-\-bin\-width option.
.SS Example
.sp
To generate a DVH for a single 2 Gy fraction, we might choose 250 bins each of
width 1 cGy.  If the input dose is already specified in cGy, you would
use the following command:

registration of two images.
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch register command_file
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The command file is an ordinary text file, which contains a single
global section and one or more stages sections.
The global section begins with a line containing only the string "[GLOBAL]",
and each stage begins with a line containing the string "[STAGE]".
.sp
The global section is used to set input files, output files, and
global parameters, while the each stage section defines a sequential
stage of processing.  For a complete description of the command file
syntax, please refer to the \fIregistration_command_file_reference\fP.
.SS Examples

.SH PLASTIMATCH THUMBNAIL
.sp
The \fIthumbnail\fP command generates a two\-dimensional thumbnail image of an
axial slice of the input volume.  The output image
is not required to correspond exactly to an integer slice number.
The location of the output image within the slice is always centered.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:

.ft C
Usage: plastimatch thumbnail [options] input\-file
Options:
  \-\-input file
  \-\-output file
  \-\-thumbnail\-dim size
  \-\-thumbnail\-spacing size

.SH PLASTIMATCH UNION
.sp
The \fIunion\fP command creates a binary volume which is the
logical union of two input images.  Voxels in the output
image have
value one if the voxel is non\-zero in either input image,
or value zero if the voxel is zero in both input images.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:

.SH PLASTIMATCH WARP
.sp
The \fIwarp\fP command is an alias for \fIconvert\fP.
Please refer to \fI\%plastimatch convert\fP for the list of command line
parameters.
.SS Examples
.sp
To warp an image using the B\-spline coefficients generated by the
plastimatch register command (saved in the file bspline.txt), do the
following:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In the previous example, the output file geometry was determined by the
geometry information in the bspline coefficient file.  You can resample
to a different geometry using \-\-fixed, or \-\-origin, \-\-dim, and \-\-spacing.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt \e
  \-\-fixed reference.nrrd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When warping a structure set image, where the integer bits correspond to
structure membership, you need to use nearest neighbor interpolation
rather than linear interpolation.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input structures\-in.nrrd \e
  \-\-output structures\-out.nrrd \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt \e
  \-\-interpolation nn
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Sometimes, voxels located outside of the geometry of the input image
will be warped into the geometry of the output image.  By default, these
areas are "filled in" with an intensity of zero.  You can choose a different
value for these areas using the \-\-default\-val option.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input infile.nrrd \e
  \-\-output outfile.nrrd \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt \e
  \-\-default\-val \-1000
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In addition to images and structures, landmarks exported from 3D Slicer can
also be warped.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \e
  \-\-output\-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \e
  \-\-xf bspline.txt
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Sometimes, it may be desirable to apply a transform explicitly defined by a
vector field instead of using B\-spline coefficients.  To allow this, the \-\-xf
option also accepts vector field volumes.  For example, the previous example
would become.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch warp \e
  \-\-input fixed_landmarks.fcsv \e
  \-\-output\-pointset warped_landmarks.fcsv \e
  \-\-xf vf.mha

.SH PLASTIMATCH XF-CONVERT
.sp
The \fIxf\-convert\fP command converts between transform types.
A tranform can be either a B\-spline transform, or a vector field.
There are two different kinds of B\-spline transform formats:
the plastimatch native format, and the ITK format.
In addition to converting the transform type, the \fIxf\-convert\fP command
can also change the grid\-spacing of B\-spline transforms.
.sp
The command line usage is given as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Usage: plastimatch xf\-convert [options]
Options:
  \-\-dim <arg>            Size of output image in voxels "x [y z]"
  \-\-grid\-spacing <arg>   B\-spline grid spacing in mm "x [y z]"
  \-\-input <arg>          Input xform filename (required)
  \-\-nobulk               Omit bulk transform for itk_bspline
  \-\-origin <arg>         Location of first image voxel in mm "x y z"
  \-\-output <arg>         Output xform filename (required)
  \-\-output\-type <arg>    Type of xform to create (required), choose from
                          {bspline, itk_bspline, vf}
  \-\-spacing <arg>        Voxel spacing in mm "x [y z]"
.ft P
.fi
.SS Example
.sp
We want to convert a B\-spline transform into a vector field.  If the
B\-spline transform is in native\-format, the vector field
geometry is defined by the values found in the transform header.:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch xf\-convert \e
  \-\-input bspline.txt \e
  \-\-output vf.mha \e
  \-\-output\-type vf
.ft P

Likewise, if we want to convert a vector field into a set of B\-spline
coefficients with a control\-point spacing of 30 mm in each direction.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
plastimatch xf\-convert \e
  \-\-input vf.mha \e
  \-\-output bspline.txt \e
